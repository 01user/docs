title: "What is Multi-factor Authentication?"
---
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a method of identifyng users by presenting two or more separate authentication stages. 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) is the most used type of MFA.

Typically, Multi-Factor Authentication requires a combination of something the user knows, something the user has, and sometimes something the user is.

* Knowledge factors, such as passwords, PINs, or secret questions.
* Possesion factors, such as an access card, phone, or hardware key.
* Inherence factors, which are biometric information, such as the user's fingerprint, face, or voice.
