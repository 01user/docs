      Released new version of [Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/preview/refresh-token). The legacy version is still in place and you can find it at [Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/refresh-token). The legacy doc will be served as default, with a panel at the top referring to the updated one.
