# Block and Unblock Users

To disable a user's access to your apps, you can block the user in the Dashboard.

1. To block a user, navigate to the [Users](${manage_url}/#/users) page in the Dashboard. Click the name of the user you want to block. When the User Details page opens, click the "Actions" button. Select **Block User** from the dropdown menu.
