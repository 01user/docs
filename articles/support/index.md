:::panel-info Trial Subscriptions
New Auth0 customers receive Standard Support during the 22-day trial period (customers may check on how many trial days they have left by logging into the [Dashboard](${manage_url})). If necessary, customers may request a one-day trial extension using the [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/).

At the end of the trial period, customers who have not opted to purchase a paid subscription can use the Auth0 Community for assistance. They will no longer have access to the [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/).

### Standard Support

Customers with a paid Auth0 subscription plan receive Standard Support, which offers access to the following channels:

The Auth0 Support Center offers ticketed support, where dedicated support specialists are available to provide assistance.

## Support Channels
