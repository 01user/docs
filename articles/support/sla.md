## Subscription Services Availability

If Auth0 fails to meet the Availability Service Level during any given month and Customer requests a Service Level Credit, then Auth0 will provide Customer with a Service Level Credit equal to the percentage of the Monthly Subscription Fees for the month in which the service level failure occurred, corresponding to the Auth0 Platform Availability Level specified in the “Availability Service Level Credits” table below. Each Service Level Credit will be paid by Auth0 to Customer by way of a credit on the next invoice submitted by Auth0 to Customer. If any credits are unutilized upon expiration or termination of the Subscription Term, than Auth0 will apply such credits to any other Fees or expenses payable by Customer to Auth0. If there are no such other Fees or expenses, then Auth0 will pay Customer the credit amount.
