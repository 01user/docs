# Child Account Request Process

This request process is for self-service customers requesting a development, test, or staging account that's linked to their paid production account. This account is called a **child account**.

::: note
Free accounts do not include a child account.
:::

## Child Account Policy

* If you're billed $167 USD/month (or more), you're eligible for one free child account with the same plan/features as the production account.
* Your child account is subject to Auth0â€™s [Operational Policies](/policies).
* If you cancel your paid subscription plan and Auth0 downgrades your child account to the free plan, you'll lose access to features (as outlined in [pricing](https://auth0.com/pricing)) available to paid plans.

::: warning
Child accounts **must not** be used in production environments.
:::

## Request a Child Account

Please use the [Auth0 Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) to request that a child account be created for you. Requests must be made at least five business days in advance of your desired implementation date.

Please include the following information with your request:

* The name of the paid Auth0 account to which the child account will be linked
* The name of the new Auth0 child account

## Alter Your Account's Subscription Plan

If you are upgrading the subscription plan associated with your paid account, your child account will be upgraded as well. If you downgrade, your child account will also be affected -- please contact the Auth0 Support team using the [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) for additional details.

## Child Account Cloud Region

The child account does **not** have to be located in the same cloud environment as your production account.

## Additional Child Accounts

Generally speaking, we only permit one child account per paid production account. However, if you need additional accounts, please contact us via the [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) and include the following information with your request:

* The name of the paid Auth0 account to which the additional child account will be linked
* The number of new child accounts needed
* A name for each of the new child accounts

In limited circumstances, you may have up to three child accounts associated with a paid account. However, we encourage you to use as few child accounts as possible.

## Usage

Activity and usage on child accounts count toward the master's account activity and usage limitations.
