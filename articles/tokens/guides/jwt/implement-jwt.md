## How to implement JWT


The safest way to implement JWT-based authentication, is to use one of the existing open source libraries. In [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) you can find several, for .NET, Python, Java, Ruby, Objective-C, Swift, PHP, and more.

JSON Tokens contain three pieces: a header, payload (which contains _claims_ about an entity), and a signature. To learn about the structure of a JWT, refer to [JSON Web Token (JWT) Structure](/tokens/reference/jwt/jwt-structure).


To verify JWT (or manually create one), you can use the [JWT.io Debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io).
