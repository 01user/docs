## Sending a guardian enrollment email to a User.

This allows an administrator to send an email to a particular user with a link that leads to the guardian enrollment step. This step is when a user registers a device with Guardian MFA.  

To send this email:

1. Find and select the user in the [Users](${manage_url}/#/users) section of the dashboard.
2. Once you have selected the affected user, click on the **Actions** button on the top right of the screen. 
3. Select **Send Enrollment Email (Guardian)** from the dropdown.

That will send an email to the user registered email.
