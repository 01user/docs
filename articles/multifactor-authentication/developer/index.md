# Developer Resources for Guardian

At Auth0, we believe in giving developers the tools they need to get their jobs done. With Guardian, developers are able to customize their users' experience, and even build their own applications on top of our multi-factor capabilities.

## Getting started with Guardian within your application

Most often, administrators will manage multi-factor configuration for an application from the Dasbboard. For more advanced use cases, Guardian provides developers the ability to control user access directly.

* [Example Application using Guardian for multi-factor Authentication](https://github.com/auth0/guardian-example)
* [Step-up Authentication](/multifactor-authentication/step-up-authentication)

## Customize the Guardian widget

Use our Guardian client libraries to apply the look-and-feel of your organization.

* [Client library for Auth0 Guardian](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-guardian.js)
* [Creating a Custom Guardian Widget](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-guardian.js/tree/master/example)

## Manage enrollments

Directly customize the enrollment process for your users.

* [Custom enrollment](/multifactor-authentication/developer/custom-enrollment-ticket)

## Build custom mobile applications

Developers can build custom _white-label_ Guardian-like applications, or add multi-factor functionality into their own applications.
