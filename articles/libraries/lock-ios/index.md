# Lock for iOS and OS X

[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps and Salesforce.

Lock makes it easy to integrate SSO in your app. You won't have to worry about:

* Having a professional looking login dialog that displays well on any device.
* Finding the right icons for popular social providers.
* Solving the home realm discovery challenge with enterprise users (i.e.: asking the enterprise user the email, and redirecting to the right enterprise identity provider).
* Implementing a standard sign in protocol (OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Login)

## Key features

* **Integrates** your iOS app with **Auth0** (OS X coming soon).
* Provides a **beautiful native UI** to log your users in.
* Provides support for **Social Providers** (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), **Enterprise Providers** (AD, LDAP, etc.) and **Username & Password**.
* Provides the ability to do **SSO** with 2 or more mobile apps similar to Facebook and Messenger apps.
* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) integration using **iOS 8** [Extension](https://github.com/AgileBits/onepassword-app-extension).
* Passwordless authentication using **TouchID** and **SMS**.

## Requierements

iOS 7+. If you need to use our SDK in an earlier version please use our previous SDK pod `Auth0Client` or check the branch [old-sdk](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.iOS-OSX/tree/old-sdk) of this repo.

## Install

The Lock is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

${snippet(meta.snippets.dependencies)}

Then in your project's `Info.plist` file add the following entries:

* __Auth0ClientId__: The client ID of your application in __Auth0__.
* __Auth0Domain__: Your account's domain in __Auth0__.

> You can find these values in your app's settings in [Auth0 dashboard](${uiURL}/#/applications).

For example:

[![Auth0 plist](http://assets.auth0.com/mobile-sdk-lock/example-plist.png)](http://auth0.com)

Also you need to register a Custom URL type, it must have a custom scheme with the following format `a0<Your Client ID>`. For example if your Client ID is `Exe6ccNagokLH7mBmzFejP` then the custom scheme should be `a0Exe6ccNagokLH7mBmzFejP`.

Before you start using Lock, we need to import Lock to your codebase, if you are still working in Objective-C you need to import this header when you need to use Lock's classes:

```objc
#import <Lock/Lock.h>
```

The same applies if you are working in Swift and Lock is included as a static library but the header must be included in your _Objective-C Bridging Header_.

> If you need help creating the Objective-C Bridging Header, please check the [wiki](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html)

If you are working in Swift with Lock included as an framework, just include in your swift files the module like this:

```swift
import Lock
```

Now it's time to initialize `A0Lock`, which will help you handle the authentication for you, and keep it in your AppDelegate as a **strong** property. We will create it inside `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

> You can store `A0Lock` in another place if you prefer, as long as you keep it alive as long as you need it.

```objc
self.lock = [A0Lock newLock];
```

```swift
self.lock = A0Lock()
```

Then call this method

```objc
[self.lock applicationLaunchedWithOptions:launchOptions];
```

```swift
self.lock.applicationLaunchedWithOptions(launchOptions)
```

Finally you'll need to handle the already registered custom scheme in your AppDelegate, so override `-application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:` method and add the following line:

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
    return [self.lock handleURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication];
}
```
```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: AnyObject?) -> Bool {
    return self.lock.handleURL(url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication)
}
```

> This is required to be able to return back to your application when authenticating with Safari (or native integration with FB or Twitter if used). This call checks the URL and handles all that have the custom scheme defined before.

## Usage

### Email/Password, Enterprise & Social authentication

`A0LockViewController` will handle Email/Password, Enterprise & Social authentication based on your Application's connections enabled in your [Auth0's Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social).

First instantiate `A0LockViewController` and register the authentication callback that will receive the authenticated user's credentials. Finally present it as a modal view controller:

```objc
A0Lock *lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
A0LockViewController *controller = [lock newLockViewController];
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = ^(A0UserProfile *profile, A0Token *token) {
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
};
[self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];
```
```swift
let lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
let controller = lock.newLockViewController()
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = {(profile: A0UserProfile!, token: A0Token!) -> () in
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}
self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
And you'll see our native login screen

> By default all social authentication will be done using Safari, if you want native integration please check this [wiki page](/libraries/lock-ios/native-social-authentication).

Also you can check our [Swift](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.iOS-OSX/tree/master/Examples/basic-sample-swift) and [Objective-C](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.iOS-OSX/tree/master/Examples/basic-sample) example apps. For more information on how to use **Lock** with Swift please check [this guide](/libraries/lock-ios/swift).

### TouchID

`A0TouchIDLockViewController` authenticates without using a password with TouchID. In order to be able to authenticate the user, your application must have a Database connection enabled.

First instantiate `A0TouchIDLockViewController` and register the authentication callback that will receive the authenticated user's credentials. Finally present it to the user:
```objc
A0Lock *lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
A0TouchIDLockViewController *controller = [lock newTouchIDViewController];
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = ^(A0UserProfile *profile, A0Token *token) {
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
};
[lock presentTouchIDController:controller fromController:self];
```

```swift
let lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
let controller = lock.newTouchIDViewController()
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = {(profile: A0UserProfile!, token: A0Token!) -> () in
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}
lock.presentTouchIDController(controller, fromController: self)
```
And you'll see TouchID login screen

> Because it uses a Database connection, the user can change it's password and authenticate using email/password whenever needed. For example when you change your device.


## SSO

A very cool thing you can do with Lock is use SSO. Imagine you want to create 2 apps. However, you want that if the user is logged in in app A, he will be already logged in in app B as well. Something similar to what happens with Messenger and Facebook as well as Foursquare and Swarm.

Read [this guide](/libraries/lock-ios/sso-on-mobile-apps) to learn how to accomplish this with this library.

> For more information please check Lock's documentation in [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/Lock).
