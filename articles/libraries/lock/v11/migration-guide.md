# Migration Guide: Lock v10 to v11

Lock 11 is designed for embedded login scenarios. It operates with enhanced security and removes dependencies that have been deprecated as per Auth0's roadmap. In some cases, these security enhancements may impact application behavior when upgrading from an earlier version of Lock. 

This document lists all the changes that you should be aware of between versions 10 and 11 of Lock. It includes information on what is changing and why, details on new or deprecated features, and instructions on how you can migrate your implementation.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can submit them using the [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}), or directly through your account representative, if applicable. 

## Cross-Origin Authentication

To use Lock 11 with any connection that requires a username and password, the connection must have [Cross Origin Authentication](/cross-origin-authentication) enabled in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}) under Client Settings -> Advanced -> OAuth.

## Allowed Web Origins

In order to use Embedded Login you need to whitelist the website(s) where you will embed the login dialog in the  **Allowed Web Origins** and the **Allowed Origins (CORS)** fields:

## Browsers with Third-Party Cookies Disabled

Embedded login will not work with [some browser versions](/cross-origin-authentication#browser-testing-matrix) when they have third-party cookies disabled. To remediate this issue, follow these instructions on [Embedded Login and Third-Party Cookies](/cross-origin-authentication#create-a-cross-origin-fallback-page).

If third-party cookies are disabled and embedded login does not function, you will get an error that can be handled clientside, such as:

```js
lock.on('authorization_error', function(error) {
  // Do something
});
```

## Usage in Hosted Login Pages

Lock 11 is designed for embedded login scenarios and is not supported in centralized login scenarios (i.e. Hosted Login Pages). If you wish to use Lock in your Auth0 Hosted Login Page, you will need to continue using Lock 10.

## Single Sign On Using IP Ranges

In Lock 10, you could configure an IP range in an Active Directory/LDAP connection. You could then use that range to allow integrated Windows Authentication if the user's IP was within the range. When this was true, Lock would display a button enabling SSO for that user as shown below.

This functionality has been removed from Lock 11. There is no IP detection and the user will get redirected to the Active Directory login page where they will have to type in their credentials.

At the moment, the request will return the following response from Lock 11:

```js
{
  "error":"invalid_request",
  "error_description":"Connection strategy not supported."
}
```

## Default Values

Both Lock 11 and Auth0.js 9 will default the `scope` parameter to `'openid profile email'`. This is to make `getSSOData` and the "Last Logged in With" window work correctly.

### getProfile

In Lock 10 this function received a string parameter with an ID Token. If you choose to use it in Lock 11, it needs to receive an Access Token. Youâ€™ll need to update your code to change the parameter sent. The method now mirrors the functionality of the `getUserInfo` method.

### oidcConformant

The `oidcConformant` flag was used in Lock 10 to force Lock not to call legacy endpoints. Lock 11 never uses these legacy endpoints, so the flag is unnecessary. If specified, it will simply be ignored.
