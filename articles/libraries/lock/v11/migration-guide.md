# Migrating to Lock v11

Lock 11 is designed for **embedded login** scenarios. It operates with enhanced security and removes dependencies that have been deprecated as per Auth0's roadmap. In some cases, these security enhancements may impact application behavior when upgrading from an earlier version of Lock. 

We recommend that instead of using Lock embedded in your application, you use **Centralized Login**, as it is the [most secure, powerful and flexible approach for authentication](/guides/login/centralized-vs-embedded).

## Migration Instructions

If you decide to keep using Lock you will need to migrate to Lock 11.

The documents below describe all the changes that you should be aware of when migrating from different versions of Lock. Make sure you go through them before upgrading.
