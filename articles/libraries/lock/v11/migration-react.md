# Migrating React.JS Applications to Lock v11

React.JS applications use Lock.js directly without any kind of wrapper library.

Most React.JS applications will be using Lock 10, so you can follow the [Migrating from Lock.js v10](migration-v10-v11.md) guide.

If you were an early React.JS and Auth0 adopter, and are using Lock 9, you can follow the [Migrating from Lock.js v9](migration-v9-v11.md) guide.
