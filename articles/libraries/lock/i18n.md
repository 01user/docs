You can call instantiate the widget with the `dict` option:

```javascript
var lock = new Auth0Lock('dsa7d77dsa7d7', 'mine.auth0.com');

lock.show({
  dict: 'es'
});
```

Where dict can be a string matching the name of the file in the `i18n` folder or it could be an object literal as follows:

```javascript
var lock = new Auth0Lock('dsa7d77dsa7d7', 'mine.auth0.com');

lock.show({
  dict: {
    "loadingTitle": "loading...",
    "close": "close",
    "signin": {
    ..//same as in i18n json files
  }
});
```
