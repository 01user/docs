[![Auth0](https://cloudup.com/c2evgl2cz3j+)](http://auth0.com)

[Auth0](http://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps, Salesforce.

[Lock 10][lock-10] makes it easy to integrate SSO in your app. You won't have to worry about:

* Having a professional looking login dialog that displays well on any resolution and device.
* Finding the right icons for popular social providers.
* Remembering what was the identity provider the user chose the last time.
* Solving the home realm discovery challenge with enterprise users (having to ask enterprise users for their email, and then attempt to redirect to the right enterprise identity provider).
* Implementing a standard sign in protocol (OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Login)

> You can try it out yourself online at our [Auth0 Lock playground][playground-url].
