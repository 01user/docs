### SSO with embedded authentication

Single sign-on can be achieved with embedded login scenarios, but only in some cases, and with limitations. For this reason, Auth0's recommendation is that any client applications which require SSO, especially between multiple domains or with third-party applications, should use [universal login](/hosted-pages/login) rather than embedded login.
