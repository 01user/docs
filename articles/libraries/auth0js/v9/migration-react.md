# Migrating React.JS Applications to Auth0.js v9

React.JS applications use Auth0.js directly without any kind of wrapper library.

Most Auth0.JS applications will be using Auth0.js v8, so you can follow the [Migrating from Auth0.js v8](migration-v8-v9.md) guide.

If you were an early React.JS and Auth0 adopter, and are using Auth0.js v7, you can follow the [Migrating from Auth0.js v7](migration-v7-v9.md) guide.
