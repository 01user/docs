# Migrating from Embedded to Centralized Login

When you integrate Auth0 in our applications, you have to decide whether you will use embedded or centralized login.

- With embedded login the login dialog is hosted in your application. You can use Lock or create your own UI.
- With centralized ogin, you redirect to Auth0-hosted pages where the authentication flow is performed.

Centralized login has several advantages over embedded login. For a detailed analysis refer to [Centralized vs Embedded Login](/guides/login/centralized-vs-embedded).

We put together a set of articles to help you migrate to centralized login in different scenarios. 

You can also find how to implement Centralized Login in multiple technology stacks using [our Quickstarts](/quickstart).
