# Data Export Policy
If you would like to export your data from Auth0 there are a several ways you can do this. You can use our [Import/Export Extension](/extensions/user-import-export) to export nearly all data in your Auth0 tenent. You can also use the [Management API](/api/management/v2) to export specific types of data.

## Can I export password hashes?
If you are a paying customer we can perform a data dump that contains password hashes for you. In order to do this you need to work with our support team. Start by opening a [support ticket](https://support.auth0.com).
