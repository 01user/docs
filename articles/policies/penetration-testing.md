# Penetration Testing Policy

::: warning
This policy is effective August 1, 2017.
:::

While conducting a security test of your own application it is not permitted to directly test Auth0 infrastructure (e.g. `tenant.auth0.com`) without prior approval. Please notify us in advance via the [Auth0 support center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}). We do not need to be notified if the test is isolated to your infrastructure.

It is not permitted to conduct any [load testing](/policies/load-testing) (e.g. Denial of Service testing) as covered by the load testing policy.

Hosted and on-premise private SaaS customers may request permission to run a penetration test via the [Auth0 support center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}).
