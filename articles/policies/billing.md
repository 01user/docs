# Billing Policy

The following policy governs requests for billing mechanisms within the Auth0 dashboard.

## Change of billing email address

It is possible to change the billing email address, but for security reasons the request should be performed by a Dashboard administrator by filing a new ticket through our [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com). A member of our support team will then contact you in that same ticket with steps on how the request will proceed.
Please note that if you are not a Dashboard administrator, we will not process this request.

### Special case

Please note that the customers who created tenants via the Heroku hosting platform or Azure Marketplace have to change the billing email address (or any other billing details) in those platforms. We cannot edit any billing information if you have used one of those services.

## Why is my credit card failing?
The only way to determine the reason for the failure is for the customer to contact their credit card company by calling the number on the back. This can be triggered by a credit card reaching the limit or simply being rejected by the bank, for example.

### My credit card is failing and some features are not available anymore
If your credit card fails to be charged, we automatically retry to charge it up to 4 times. If you fix the issue before the fourth failure (by entering new card information or by solving the issue with the bank), then the charge will go through and everything will work as expected.

However, if the problem is not fixed prior to the fourth failure, all past due invoices will be manually initiated by Auth0. This means that you may be charged in an unexpected date. 

*Please note the following:* If you are having issues with the service, it is not due to the credit card failing.
