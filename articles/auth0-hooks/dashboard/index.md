# Create a New Hook Using the Management Dashboard

You can create new Hooks using the Auth0 Management Dashboard.

## Create a New Hook

1. Navigate to the Hooks page of the Management Dashboard. You can create new Hooks in one of two ways:

  a. Click on the **+ Create New Hook** button at the top right of the Hooks page.
  b. Finding the extensibility hook you want to work with and then clicking the **Create New Hook** link below.

2. On the *New Hook* pop-up window, provide the requested information:

  * **Name**: The name for your new Hook
  * **Hook**: The extensibility point associated with your Hook

  Click **Create** to create your Hook.

3. Once you create your hook, it will be listed under its extensibility point. There are two icons at the right side of the Hook's row listing:

  * Click the **Pencil and Paper** icon to open the Webtask Editor and edit your Hook.
  * Click the **Gear** icon if you would like to *rename* or *delete* your Hook.
