# Manage Existing Hooks Using the Management Dashboard

Once you have created your Hooks, you can manage them using the Auth0 Management Dashboard. You can:

* Enable or disable a Hook for a given extensibility point;
* Delete a Hook;
* Rename a Hook;
* Open up the Webtask Editor to change a Hook's JavaScript code.

The Hooks page of the Management Dashboard lists the Hooks associated with your Auth0 account. They are organized by extensibility point, and you can see which (if any) Hook is enabled for that point.

There are two icons to the right of each Hook, allowing you to manage your Hooks individually:

  * Click the **Pencil and Paper** icon to open the Webtask Editor and edit your Hook.

  * Click the **Gear** icon if you would like to *rename* or *delete* your Hook.
