# Custom Signup

In some cases, you may want to customize the user sign up form with more fields other than email and password. Read below to learn how to do it using Lock or the API.

## Using Lock

Lock 10 supports custom fields for the signup. Read more: [Lock 10 Preview Release](/libraries/lock/v10).

## Using the API

### 1. Create a Sign Up form to capture custom fields

```html
<form id="signup">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Sign up</legend>
    <p>
      <input type="email" id="signup-email" placeholder="Email" required/>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="password" id="signup-password" placeholder="Password"
             required/>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Full name" required/>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="text" id="color" placeholder="Favorite color"/>
    </p>
    <input type="submit" value="Sign up"/>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

Notice that `name` and `color` are custom fields.

> Note that there is currently no way to validate user-supplied custom fields when signing up.
Validation must be done from an Auth0 rule when logging in, or with custom logic in your application.

### 2. Send the Form Data

Send a POST request to the /dbconnections/signup endpoint in Auth0. You will need to send your `ClientId`, the `email` and `password` of the user being signed up and the custom fields as part of `user_metadata`.

```har
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/dbconnections/signup",
  "headers": [{
    "name": "Content-Type",
    "value": "application/json"
  }],
  "postData": {
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "text": "{\"client_id\": \"${account.clientId}\",\"email\": \"$('#signup-email').val()\",\"password\": \"$('#signup-password').val()\",\"user_metadata\": {\"name\": \"john\",\"color\": \"red\"}}"
  }
}
```

## Custom Fields Limitations

When your users sign up, the custom fields are sent as part of `user_metadata`. Limitations of this field are:

* `user_metadata` must contain no more than 10 fields;
* `user_metadata.field` must be a string;
* `user_metadata.field.value.length` must be fewer than 500 characters;
* `user_metadata.field.length` must be fewer than 100 characters.

## Redirect mode

Popup mode may be inappropriate for regular web apps or mobile apps. To
use redirect mode, configure a callback URL when calling `auth0.signup`. After a
successful login, Auth0 will redirect the user to the configured callback URL
with a JWT (`id_token`) in the query string.

> [To learn more about the differences between popup and redirect modes,
please refer to this document](/libraries/lock/v10/popup-mode).

```js
window.auth0 = new Auth0({
  domain: '${account.namespace}',
  clientID: '${account.clientId}',
  // Callback made to your server's callback endpoint
  callbackURL: '${account.callback}',
});
```

Your server will then need to call APIv2 to add the necessary custom fields to
the user's profile.

## Add Username to Sign Up form

One very simple signup customization is to add a `username` to the signup.

To set this up, turn on the `Requires Username` setting under [Connections > Database](${uiURL}/#/connections/database/) under the Settings tab for the connection you wish to edit.

Once this has been done, when a user is created manually in the Auth0 dashboard, then the screen where you enter user information will prompt for both email and username.

Similarly, the Lock widget in sign up mode will prompt for username, email and password.

Then when a user authenticates, they can log in with Username and Password.


## Optional: Verifying password strength

Password policies for database connections can be configured in the dashboard.
For more information, [check out the documentation](password-strength).

The configured password policies, along with other connection information, can be retrieved publicly by accessing a JSONP file at the following URL:

    https://cdn.auth0.com/client/${account.clientId}.js

This file can then be parsed client-side to find the current password policy configured in the dashboard.
[Here is an example of how this can be done](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-password-policy-sample).
