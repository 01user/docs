Passwordless connections in Auth0 allow users to login without the need to remember a password.

This improves the user experience, especially on mobile applications, since users will only need an email address or phone number to register for your application.

Without passwords, your application will not need to implement a password reset procedure and users avoid the insecure practice of using the same password for many purposes.

In addition, the credential used for authentication is automatically validated since the user just entered it at sign-up.
