# Connections

A connection is the relationship between Auth0 and a source of users. Auth0 sits between your application and its sources of users, which adds a level of abstraction so your application is isolated from any changes to and idiosyncrasies of each source's implementation.

Connections can be categorized as:
- Identity Provider
- Database
- Passwordless
