# User Guide: Passwordless

Notes from Yvonne:

* Describe the end-user experience with passwordless - what happens
* Describe what to do if there are delays - don’t keep requesting new ones
* Describe that there is a timeout on the link - configurable - but probably won’t work several days later
* If end user requests multiple links - which one(s) are valid - all or just most recent
* What to do if user has multiple devices
* Can users share passwords with passwordless

## Introduction

If you are using an app that allows for **Passwordless** authentication, you can log in without going through the usual steps of providing a login/password combination.

To gain access, you provide either your **email address** or your **mobile phone number**.

If you provide your **email address**, you will receive an email containing either:

* a link you need to click on to validate yourself, or;

* a code you need to provide to the app to validate yourself.
