By default, normalized user profile attributes are not directly editable since they are updated from the identity provider each time a user logs in. If you want to be able to edit the `name`, `nickname`, `given_name`, `family_name`, or `picture` attributes on the normalized user profile, you must [specify that user attributes be updated on user profile creation only](/connections/guides/change-user-attribute-update). These fields will then be available to be edited with the Management API's [Update a User endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Users/patch_users_by_id).
