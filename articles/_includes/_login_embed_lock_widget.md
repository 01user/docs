You can also embed the Lock widget directly in your application. If you use this method, some features, such as single sign-on, will not be accessible. 
To learn how to embed the Lock widget in your application, follow the [Embedded Login sample](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/tree/embedded-login/01-Embedded-Login).
