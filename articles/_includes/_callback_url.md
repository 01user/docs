## Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects to after the user has authenticated. You can whitelist any URLs to be redirected to in the **Callback URL** textbox in your [Application Settings](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings). Be sure to set these URLs to avoid mismatch errors on login.
