# Jumpstart

This offering consists of 3 blocks of 4 hours each covering:

### Scenario Guidance:

A lighter weight version of [full Scenario Guidance offering](/scenario-guidance), this activity is designed to help you assess your requirements, and jointly draft a solution to address these.

We recommend completing this activity during the first 60 days of your subscription.

### Code review / programming advisory:

A quick review of your implementation, including integration with your applications, general Auth0 configuration, rules, custom db connections, etc. The goal is to make sure you are optimally using Auth0's capabilities.

This is an activity we'd recommend completing no later than  your subscription mid-term.

### Architectural Review:

This activity is designed to perform an evaluation of the Auth0 installation to ensure optimal use. It's an opportunity to update any documentation available, and includes an overview of different environments, applications, connections, and overall configuration. It also includes a walk-through of Auth0's roadmap, features to come, and an open discussion about other usage of Auth0 inside the company in the near future.
