# Manage Users Using the Management API

You can retrieve, create, update or delete users using our [Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users).

1. First, you have to generate an Access Token to call the Management API. For information on how to do that refer to [The Auth0 Management APIv2 Token](/api/management/v2/tokens).

2. Instead of making the HTTP calls directly, and depending on the platform you use, you can use one of our SDKs. 

For a list of available SDKs, refer to [the SDKs section of our Support Matrix](/support/matrix#sdks).
