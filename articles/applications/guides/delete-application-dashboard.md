# Delete an Application using the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the [Application Settings](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings), and scroll to the end of the page. Under the *Danger Zone* section you can find the **Delete Application** button. This operation cannot be undone.

Once you click on the button a pop-up window will ask you to confirm the action. Click **Yes, delete application** to permanently remove the application.

::: note
You can also delete an application using the [DELETE /api/v2/clients/{id} endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Clients/delete_clients_by_id) of the Management API.
