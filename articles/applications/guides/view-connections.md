# View Connections

You can configure any number of [connections](/connections) through the Dashboard, and then enable them for any application or API.

To view all the connections that you have configured or to create new ones, navigate to the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/) and select a connection type:

- [Database](${manage_url}/#/connections/database)
- [Social](${manage_url}/#/connections/social)
- [Enterprise](${manage_url}/#/connections/enterprise)
- [Passwordless](${manage_url}/#/connections/passwordless)

For more details on the connections you can configure, see [Identity Providers Supported by Auth0](/identityproviders).
