## Applications in Auth0

To add authentication to your application, you must first register it with Auth0 and select an application type. Auth0 recognizes four application types:

- **Native/Mobile Apps**: Mobile, desktop, or hybrid apps that run natively in a device (e.g., Android, iOS, Ionic, Windows, OS/X). Learn to [configure your Native/Mobile App using the Dashboard](/applications/native).

- **Single Page Apps (SPAs)**: JavaScript front-end applications that run in a browser (e.g., Angular, jQuery, React). Learn to [configure your Single Page App using the Dashboard](/applications/spa).

- **Regular Web Apps**: Traditional web applications that run on a server (e.g., ASP .NET, Java, Ruby on Rails, Node.js). Learn to [configure your Regular Web App using the Dashboard](/applications/webapps).

- **Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Apps**: Non-interactive applications, such as command-line tools, daemons, IoT devices, or services running on your back-end. Typically, you use this option if you have a service that requires access to an API. Learn to [configure your M2M App using the Dashboard](/applications/machine-to-machine).


Auth0 also differentiates between [public and private applications](/applications/application-types#confidential-vs-public-applications), as well as [first- vs. third-party applications](/applications/application-types#first-vs-third-party-applications).
