# Auth0 Appliance: Instrumentation

To make it easy for interested parties, such as your Appliance administrators or Auth0 Customer Success Engineers, to gather information about the current/previous state of the Appliance or diagnose issues, you can enable a feature called Instrumentation. By doing this, you are collecting data about the overall Appliance instance, as well as individual processes. You can then query or visualize this data.
