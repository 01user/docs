# Enterprise - Private Cloud

Users with requirements not met by the Auth0 Public Cloud may instead opt for an Enterprise - Private Cloud option.

Auth0 currently offers the following private cloud options:

* Enterprise - Private Cloud
* Enterprise - Managed Private Cloud (either hosted by Auth0 or hosted by you on an AWS environment)

This overview covers specifically the **Enterprise - Private Cloud** option.

## What is the Enterprise - Private Cloud?

The Enterprise - Private Cloud provides you with a dedicated (or single-tenant) environment. You'll get enhanced performance, security, and compliance over what we include in our standard Public Cloud offering.

With the Enterprise - Private Cloud, Auth0 will handle a majority of the requirements for initial setup and maintenance. Afterward, you'll be on a set update pattern.

You'll get the ease of management that comes with using our Public Cloud combined with the power and security of our Managed Private Cloud.
