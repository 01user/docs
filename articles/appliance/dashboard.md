# Appliance Management Dashboard

The management dashboard is the interface through which you manage things like your applications, connections, users and rules. Everything you manage for these areas in the cloud service are also manageable available within the appliance, and so the same documentation applies.

There are additional controls though exposed in the appliance which are settings normally managed by Auth0 behind the scenes with the cloud service. These are exposed in what is referred to as the *primary domain*. Having access to these settings also gives you some additional control and flexibility when deploying the appliance. If Auth0 is operating your private deployment then these controls will not be exposed directly to you. You'll normally work with Auth0 engineers when changing settings and applying updates. There are some configuration settings there though that you can perform directly, and also information about the cluster that is useful.

When you have the primary domain selected, you'll see a link in the top right corner, *Configuration*. Select that link to be brought to the appliance configuration area.
