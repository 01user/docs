# Auth0 Features and GDPR Compliance

In this article you can find a list of GDPR regulations and find out how Auth0 can help you comply with them.

## Conditions for consent

According to article 7 of GDPR, you have to request users for consent on the processing of their personal data, in a clear and easily accessible form. You also have to be able to show that the user has consented, and provide an easy way to withdraw consent at any time. You can use Auth0 to ask your users for consent upon signup (using either Lock or a custom form), save this information at the user profile, and update it using our API. 

For all the details, see [Conditions for consent](/compliance/gdpr/features-aiding-compliance/user-consent).

## Right to access, correct, and erase data

As per articles 15, 16, 17, and 19 of GDPR, users have the right to get a copy of their personal data you are processing, ask for rectifications if they are inaccurate, and ask you to delete their personal data. With Auth0, you can access, edit, and delete user information, either manually or using our API. 

For all the details, see [Right to access, correct, and erase data](/compliance/gdpr/features-aiding-compliance/right-to-access-data).

## Data minimisation

According to article 5, personal data must be limited to what is necessary for the processing and must be kept only as long as needed. Also, they have to be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. There are several Auth0 features than can help you achieve that, like account linking, user profile encryption, and more. 

For all the details, see [Data minimisation](/compliance/gdpr/features-aiding-compliance/data-minimisation).

## Data portability

According to article 20 of GDPR, users have the right to receive the personal data concerning them in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You can export user data, stored in the Auth0 user store, either manually or programmatically. Raw data from Auth0 can be exported in JSON format (which is machine-readable). 

For all the details, see [Data portability](/compliance/gdpr/features-aiding-compliance/data-portability).

## Protect and secure user data

As per article 32 of GDPR, you have to implement appropriate measures in order to ensure a level of security, including, among other things data encryption, ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services, and more. There are several Auth0 features than can help you achieve that, like user profile encryption, brute-force protection, breached password detection, step-up authentication, and more. 

For all the details, see [Protect and secure user data](/compliance/gdpr/features-aiding-compliance/protect-user-data).
