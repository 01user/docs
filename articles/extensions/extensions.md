# Auth0 Extensions

Auth0 Extensions enable you to install applications (such as [Webtasks](https://webtask.io/)) or run commands/scripts that extend the functionality of the Auth0 base product.

Each extension is separate from all other extensions. Auth0 defines extensions per tenant, so data is stored by the pair `tenant\extension`.

When creating extensions, you have two options:
- [building off of one of Auth0's provided extensions](/extensions/using-provided-extensions.md) in the Management Portal;
- [creating and installing your own](/extensions/custom-extensions.md).
