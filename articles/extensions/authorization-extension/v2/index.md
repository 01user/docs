# Authorization Extension

The Authorization Extension provides support for user authorization via Groups, Roles, and Permissions. You can define the expected behavior during the login process, and your configuration settings will be captured in a [rule](/rules) that's executed during runtime.

:::
If you're currently using Version 1 of the Extension, see the [Migration Guide](/extensions/authorization-extension/v2/migration) for upgrade instructions.

## Get Started

Before you can use the extension, you'll need to install it, configure the rule controlling its behavior during login, and set up your user management.
