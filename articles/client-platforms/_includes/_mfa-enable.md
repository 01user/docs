The only action required in order to enable the MFA feature is open the [auth0 MFA settings]({$uiURL}/#/guardian) and enable the __Push Notifications__ option. You should see a page like that:

![dashboard MFA with push notification enabled]

After enabling it, hit the __save__ button and you're ready to test the Multi-factor authentication in your application.
