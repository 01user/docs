The only action required in order to enable the MFA feature is open the [Auth0 MFA settings](${uiURL}/#/guardian) and enable the __Push Notifications__ option. You should see a page like that:

After enabling it, hit the __save__ button and you're ready to test the Multifactor authentication in your application.
