Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is an important method to add an extra security layer to your authentication flow. With this option enabled in your auth0 account, the process to grant user access to the application will require a verification step.  Besides the username and password combination, a verification code generated by a mobile application or sent by SMS is required. Currently auth0 supports [auth0 Guardian](/multifactor-authentication/guardian), Google Authenticator and Duo. Sending the code as SMS is also an option.
