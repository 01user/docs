Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is an important method to add an extra security layer to your authentication flow. With this option enabled in your auth0 account, the process to grant user access to the application will require a verification step.  Besides the username and password combination, a verification code generated by a mobile application or sent by SMS is required. Currently auth0 supports [auth0 Guardian](/multifactor-authentication/guardian), Google Authenticator and Duo. Sending the code as SMS is also an option. For more details refer to [Multifactor Authentication in Auth0](/multifactor-authentication).

On this tutorial you'll learn how to enable MFA in a ReactJS application created in the previous steps, such as [Login](/quickstart/spa/react/01-login).

## 1. Enable Multifactor Authentication in Your Account

The only action required in order to enable the MFA feature is open the [auth0 MFA settings]({$uiURL}/#/guardian) and enable the __Push Notifications__ option. You should see a page like that:

![dashboard MFA with push notification enabled]

After enabling it, hit the __save__ button and you're ready to test the Multi-factor authentication in your application.

## 2. Login

There is no need to update the code we have created in [Login](/docs/quickstart/spa/react/01-login) tutorial. As soon you try to sign in, you should be prompted to setup an 2-Factor authenticator application (auth0 Guardian is the default).

## 3. All done!

You have completed the Multi-factor authentication setup with Auth0 in your ReactJS project.
