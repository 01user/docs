## Conditionally Assign Scopes to Users

By default, when you register scopes in your API settings, all the scopes are immediately available and can be requested by any user. 
If you want to handle access control, you need to create policies for deciding which users can get certain scopes. You can use Rules to do it. See the [Rules documentation](/rules) to learn how to use Rules to create scope policies.
