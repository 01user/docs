You can select any URL in your application for your users to return to. We recommend creating a dedicated callback route. 
If you create a single callback route, you: 
* Don't have to whitelist multiple, and sometimes unknown, callback URLs
* Can display a loading indicator to the user while the application sets up a client-side session
