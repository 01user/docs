::: panel Select a callback URL
You can select any URL in your application for your users to return to. We recommend creating a dedicated callback route. 
If you create a single callback route: 
* You don't have to whitelist many, sometimes unknown, callback URLs.
* You can display a loading indicator to the user while the application sets up a session.
