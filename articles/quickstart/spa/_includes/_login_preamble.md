The first step in adding authentication to your ${library} application is to provide a way for your users to log in. The fastest, most secure, and most feature-rich way to do this with Auth0 is to use the [hosted login page](https://auth0.com/docs/hosted-pages/login).

When authentication is successful, three items will be returned which all need to be used in the application: an `access_token`, an `id_token`, and the number of seconds until the `access_token` expires. While all of these items are important, the most useful one is the `access_token`. It's this token that can be used in calls to Auth0 to get things like the user's profile and it will also be used later to send authenticated requests to your own resource server.
