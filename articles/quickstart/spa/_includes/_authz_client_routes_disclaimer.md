## Considerations for Client-Side Access Control

In the context of access control on the **client-side**, it's important to note that any `role` claim that might exist in a user's token is simply a _clue_ that the user has a particular access level. There is nothing stopping a user from copying the JSON Web Token issued to them, pasting it into the [JWT.io](https://jwt.io) debugger, and modifying the `role` claim. In this way, a user could deliberately give themselves an access level of `admin` when they really should only have a level of `user`. Doing so, a user could force their way to a client-side route that they shouldn't have access to.

So how are you supposed to create a secure application if client-side routes are so easily hackable? The answer is that you should be keeping any and all access to sensitive data for a given client-side route on the server. Your server is the only place that can act as a secure gatekeeper for your application's data. If a user wants to get access to the data on your server, they will require a valid `access_token`. Any attempt to modify an `access_token` will invalidate it, meaning that any calls to your server with that modified token will fail. If the user were able to hack their way to a client-side route that they shouldn't be at, it wouldn't do them much good anyway, since they wouldn't be able to see any data that should be there.
