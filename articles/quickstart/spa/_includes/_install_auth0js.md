## Install auth0.js

Integrating Auth0 in your Angular 2+ application requires the **auth0.js** library. Install it using npm or yarn.

```bash
# installation with npm
npm install --save auth0-js

# installation with yarn
yarn add auth0-js
```

The **auth0.js** library can also be retrieved from Auth0's CDN.

```html
<script src="${auth0js_urlv8}"></script>
```
