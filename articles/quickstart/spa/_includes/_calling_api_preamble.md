Your single page app may need to use resources from a data API. You might want to restrict access to those resources, so that only authenticated users with authorization can access them. Auth0 lets you manage access to these resources using [API Authorization](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth).

This tutorial will show you how to access protected resources in your data API. 

::: note
This tutorial doesn't show you how to add protection to your API. Read the [Backend/API quickstart documentation](quickstart/backend) for instructions on how to protect your API.
