This quickstart guide walks you through managing authentication with Auth0 in your iOS Swift apps.

## Sample Projects

Each tutorial in the series includes a link to a sample project showing the features described in the article. You can find all the samples [here](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ios-swift-sample).

## Dependencies

Each tutorial uses the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) toolkit. It is a toolkit that lets you communicate with many of the basic [Auth0 API](/api/info) functions in a neat way.

## Create a Client

Create a new client application in your [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}/#/clients). For **Type**, select **Native**.
