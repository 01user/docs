# Single Sign On with Auth0

Single Sign On (SSO) occurs when a user logs in to one application and is then signed in to other applications automatically, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain the user is using.

::: note
The [Hosted Login Page](/hosted-pages/login) is the easiest and most secure way to implement SSO with Auth0. If you need to use embedded [Lock](/libraries/lock) or an embedded custom authentication UI in your application, check out the [Cross-Origin Authentication](/cross-origin-authentication) page for information on safely conducting SSO.
