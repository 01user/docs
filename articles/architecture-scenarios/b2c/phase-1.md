# Phase 1

During phase 1, you'll address some of the most critical aspects of integrating with Auth0. When done, you'll have a fully-functional implementation that can be used in your Production environment (or, at the very least, used as part of an early adopter or beta program).

Phase 1 consists of multiple workstreams, and each focuses on a specific aspect of the integration. The order in which you carry out the workstreams is important, and we recommend that you follow the order provided. However, certain workstreams can be tackled in parallel; if that is the case, we mention such in the descriptions below.
