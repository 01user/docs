# Consumer Identity and Access Management User Profile Management

The User Profile Management workstream addresses how you can handle changes to the information contained in user profiles. We will show you how to handle:

    * Resetting passwords
    * Managing metadata
    * Verifying accounts
    * Blocking users

## Prerequisites

* Tenant Architecture
* User Provisioning
* User Authentication
* User Authorization

## Design considerations

## Metadata

### User metadata

### App metadata

## Password reset

## Account verification

## Blocked users

## Best practices

* Any information that will be used to customise Auth0 emails, such as information used to determine the language for an email, should be stored in metadata: and preferably `user_metadata` if the user is allowed to change it.
