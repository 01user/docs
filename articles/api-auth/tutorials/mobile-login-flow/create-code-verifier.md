# Create a Code Verifier

First, you will need to generate and store a `code_verifier`, which is a cryptographically random key that, along with its transformed value (called the `code_challenge`), will be sent to Auth0 for an `authorization_code`.

For sample scripts, to generate a `code_verifier` and a `code_challenge`, refer to [Execute an Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE](/api-auth/tutorials/authorization-code-grant-pkce#1-create-a-code-verifier).
