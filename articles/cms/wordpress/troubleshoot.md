# WordPress Troubleshoot

## My configuration is wrong and I can't authenticate using Auth0

The plugin provides you an URL to access through the regular WordPress login, using a WordPress valid credentials. To access it, you need to add `?wle` to the login url, for example: `http://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php?wle`.

## I am having problems when a user logs in and I can't find what happens

The plugin provides an error log where you can check what has happened. You can access it going to the *Error Log* subitem in the *Auth0* menu.
