# Call an API from a Native/Mobile Application

Auth0 helps you to authenticate your users and issue them the appropriate Access Tokens by taking care of the technical aspects required. Your users, with Access Tokens in hand, can then call an API securely. If the Access Token expires, we'll help you refresh the token so that you can keep working.

To call an API from a Native/Mobile Application, you will need to implement the Authorization Code using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant.
