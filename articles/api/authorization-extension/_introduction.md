# Introduction

The Authorization Extension API enables you to:

- automate provisioning for your users, roles, groups, and permissions
- query the authorization context of your users in real time

In order to use it you first have to [enable API access](/extensions/authorization-extension/v2#enable-api-access) from your Authorization Dashboard.

For more information on the Authorization Extension and how to configure it refer to [Auth0 Authorization Extension](/extensions/authorization-extension).

For each endpoint in this explorer, you will find sample snippets you can use, in three available formats:

- HTTP request
- Curl command
- JavaScript: depending on the endpoint each snippet may use the [Auth0.js library](/libraries/auth0js), Node.js code or simple JavaScript
