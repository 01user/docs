# Breached Password Security

When a user receives an email requesting that they change their password immediately, it is because their account could be the victim of a security breach. This may be the result of a compromise by a third-party application that experienced a security breach. The breach may not have happened to this account, but based on avaiable data, the user's credentials may have been released. Since many people reuse passwords, the request to change passwords is a precaution to make sure the user stays protected. 

Users may also want to change their password at any other sites where they suspect they used a shared password. 

## General security tips

Users typically can't prevent certain sites from security breaches, but there are some things they can do to help keep their accounts safe.

### Check emails carefully

Check where an email is coming from and the links that they provide. Often phishing emails do not include a user's name but something generic such as "Dear Customer."  

### Reset passwords directly from sites

Always do a password reset through the actual site itself not via potentially false links in emails. Also note that secure website URL always starts with `https`.

Here are some links for password resets on commonly used sites:
* [Google](https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery/)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/settings)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/settings/password)

### Never enter personal or financial information in email

Emails in general are not very secure and re not a good way to communicate sensitive information. A trusted company/application would not ask for  information in this way. Make sure not to enter confidential information through false links in emails. 

### Never download files from unreliable sources

Most web browsers detect suspicious sites. An alert should appear when you try to access a malicious site. Never download files from suspicious emails or websites.

### Do not reuse passwords

When one site has a breach of user data, if a user uses the same credentials elsewhere, information in other sites can also be accessed. There are many password tools available to help keep track of passwords.

### Use strong passwords

The longer a password is, the harder it becomes to guess. Try to make passwords long and use a mix of special characters, numbers, and upper- and lowercase letters.

### Keep software current

Applications release patches and updates when they find security vulnerabilities in their systems. Keeping applications, web browsers, and operating systems up to date can help prevent security breaches.
