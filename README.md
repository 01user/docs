This is the repository for the Auth0 documentation.


* Always use absolute links
* Do not hard code links to auth0 sites like `docs.auth0.com`, `manage.auth0.com`, etc. Use variables instead such as `@@uiUrl@@`
* Do not store images in external locations like Dropbox, CloudUp, or the Auth0 CDN. Link to images in this repo using `![](/media/folder/image_name.png)`. The image will get automatically uploaded to the CDN and the link will be transformed.
